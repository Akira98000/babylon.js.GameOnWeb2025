## Technical Architecture

### Core Systems

- **Scene Management**: Modular level loading system with progressive asset loading
- **Entity Component System**: Object-oriented approach for game entities
- **Event System**: Custom event dispatcher for decoupled component communication
- **State Machine**: Controls player and enemy animations and behavior states
- **AI System**: Path finding and decision-making for NPCs and enemies using behavior trees
- **Collision Detection**: Custom collision groups and filtering for optimized interaction

### Rendering Pipeline

- **Dynamic Lighting**: Point, directional, and spot lights with shadow mapping
- **Particle Systems**: GPU-accelerated particles for visual effects (smoke, explosions, magic)
- **Post-Processing**: Screen-space effects including bloom, depth of field, and color grading
- **Material System**: PBR materials with normal and roughness mapping
- **Level of Detail**: Dynamic mesh simplification based on distance
- **Scene Optimization**: Frustum culling, instancing for similar meshes, and texture atlasing

### Performance Optimizations

- **Asset Loading**: Asynchronous loading with prioritization and caching
- **Memory Management**: Mesh disposal and texture compression
- **WebGL Optimization**: Minimized draw calls through mesh combining
- **Worker Threads**: Background processing for physics calculations
- **Shader Optimization**: Custom shaders for specific visual effects with minimal overhead
